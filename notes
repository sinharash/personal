I am sending you this 4 files, and please go through it and tell me what I am trying to achieve . In short , I am wrtting custom enhancedentitypicker which will be sending a template and developer would be able to populate Autocomplete filed with the data using that template, user selects the data and when click on review he is going to see whatevre he had selected, nothing else, now when user hits the create , here I wanted developer should have complete access to all information of that entity what user has selected. we are trying to form entityRef based on the template from yaml and catalog:fetch then we can have all the information. Currently I am getting error : when I hit create first step fails : Failed to extract entity refernce: Template must include 'metadata.name" to extract actual entity name, Cuurent template: "--". Metadata.name is required for catalog:fetch to work properly
